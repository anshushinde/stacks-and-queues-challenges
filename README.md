55# Stacks and Queues Challenges
Everything should be in a single file only.  Write the methods only.  You can write a main to test if you wish.

## Queues
This problem needs to use both a stack and a queue.

### Check Palindrome
- A palindrome is a word that can be spelled the same forwards and backward
- Using a stack and queue ONLY, determine whether a given string is a palindrome
    - Strings may contain punctuation and spaces.
      - They should be ignored.
      - Case should be ignored.

## Stacks
The problems below are only allowed to use stacks.

### Stack of Plates
- Prompt: Imagine you have a stack of plates.  If the plates get too high, they will topple over.  So you need to design a Stack such that when the Stack reaches a threshold of 5, it creates a new Stack to hold the new items.  Your code should be written so that it works for any threshold.

- To the outside world there should be only one stack, but behind the scenes, there should be multiple.  This means when the user is pushing or popping onto a stack they are only working with one stack in the main method to them this is the only stack that exists.

### Max on Stack
- Design a stack, which in addition to push and pop, has a function 'max' and function 'min' which returns the maximum element and minimum element in the Stack respectively.

- Push, pop, max, and min MUST all operate in O(1) time

### Bonus (0 point)
- Receive a hint on two of the challenges.

### Hints over 2 will cost points (1 per hint)

## Unit Tests
Write unit tests for each of the methods that you write.
